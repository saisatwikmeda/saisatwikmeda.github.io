			<p>A lot of web design is learnt from Odin Project. All the links are either displayed on there or some learnt personally. Most of the links are posted on the What helped tab. This website is mainly made to check the progress of what I did over time and how it helped. </p>
			<p> Right now I feel comfortable with basic CSS and html and I will slowly start transitioning into Javascript.</p>
			<p>I'm also getting familiar with the editor and also make changes to this website based on what I feel is right or wrong</p>
